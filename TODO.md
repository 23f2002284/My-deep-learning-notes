1. implement all and it's variant, record everything vizually to add in the notes and colab.
2. elaborate the observations
3. Implement all the improvements that can be done in the code and explain how these improvements can improve performance or readability
4. potential a next implementation of same after all lab completions
5. then imagenet and cifar-10 or fashion mnist or other to test ourselves
6. all of these in new notes with answer of all homeworks
7. Implement all github i have as tabs to see the implementation
8. add wait time in download to avoid error
9. optimizers and their implementation in numpy
10. thought process of writing submission - 1
11. Implementing how it would look like beyond number as accuracy. i will have a interface to see the digit guessing by my model.
12. explain the logic behind the interface as well.
13. Neural network with combination of multiple layers, single layer with different types of loss function, activation function, optimizers, initialization and more
