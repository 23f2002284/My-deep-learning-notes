1. implement all and it's variant, record everything vizually to add in the notes and colab.
2. elaborate the observations
3. Implement all the improvements that can be done in the code and explain how these improvements can improve performance or readability
4. potential a next implementation of same after all lab completions
5. then imagenet and cifar-10 or fashion mnist or other to test ourselves
6. all of these in new notes with answer of all homeworks
7. Implement all github i have as tabs to see the implementation
8. add wait time in download to avoid error
9. optimizers and their implementation in numpy
10. thought process of writing submission - 1
11. Implementing how it would look like beyond number as accuracy. i will have a interface to see the digit guessing by my model.
12. explain the logic behind the interface as well.
13. Neural network with combination of multiple layers, single layer with different types of loss function, activation function, optimizers, initialization and more
14. How the errors look like in real time like 7 as 3 learned by the model ? How ? How to see that issue ? How to fix that issue ? end-to-end ?
15. Architecture in each step
16. Use Same notation through out the notes
17. all notes from nn-3 rough to nn-3
18. all the plots properly explained which i shallowed because of lazyness #implementation 
19. strength, weakness and solution update in each. check the note if anywhere i am wrong
20. complete the next things written in nn-3
21. complete the loss function and activation in nn-4      
22. Update the numpy solutions - 2 in the link as well in the pdf
